## Introduction
São Paulo is the multi-cultural financial capital of Brazil, being home to more than 12 million people from all nationalities and costumes. Although being almost 500 years old, its historical city center is still one of the most business active regions, hosting all kinds of businesses, ranging from government agencies to corporate headquarters to generations-old family business.

## Business Problem

Considering the active background of São Paulo's historical city center, the choice of opening a new snack bar / restaurant that could serve the thousands of people who pass by every day sure looks financially viable. However, there are already a lot of those venues in the neighborhood, so the decision to open a new restaurant must come with the knowledge of which kind / specialty. This work aims to identify, based on venues density and categories, where and what kind of restaurant could be more successful opening in São Paulo historical city center. The idea is to open a small to medium business, the closest possible to the Public Ministery building and the Forum, as to maximize public from those places.

## Data

São Paulo historical city center is [comprised mainly of two districts](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centro_Hist%C3%B3rico_de_S%C3%A3o_Paulo): Sé and República, however, as no available data was publicly found with the geoinformation of that macrorregion, we'll focus on the Sé district. All venues data was acquired using FourSquare API, which includes: 

 - Venue name
 - Venue Location (Latitude and Longitude)
 - Venue Category
